5	31-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Love my Echo!	1
5	31-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Loved it!	1
4	31-Jul-18	Walnut Finish 	"Sometimes while playing a game, you can answer a question correctly but Alexa says you got it wrong and answers the same as you.  I like being able to turn lights on and off while away from home."	1
5	31-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"I have had a lot of fun with this thing. My 4 yr old learns about dinosaurs, i control the lights and play games like categories. Has nice sound when playing music as well."	1
5	31-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Music	1
5	31-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	"I received the echo as a gift. I needed another Bluetooth or something to play music easily accessible, and found this smart speaker. Can’t wait to see what else it can do."	1
3	31-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	"Without having a cellphone, I cannot use many of her features. I have an iPad but do not see that of any use.  It IS a great alarm.  If u r almost deaf, you can hear her alarm in the bedroom from out in the living room, so that is reason enough to keep her.It is fun to ask random questions to hear her response.  She does not seem to be very smartbon politics yet."	1
5	31-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	I think this is the 5th one I've purchased. I'm working on getting one in every room of my house. I really like what features they offer specifily playing music on all Echos and controlling the lights throughout my house.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	looks great	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	"Love it! I’ve listened to songs I haven’t heard since childhood! I get the news, weather, information! It’s great!"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"I sent it to my 85 year old Dad, and he talks to it constantly."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	I love it! Learning knew things with it eveyday! Still figuring out how everything works but so far it's been easy to use and understand. She does make me laugh at times	1
5	30-Jul-18	Oak Finish 	"I purchased this for my mother who is having knee problems now, to give her something to do while trying to over come not getting around so fast like she did.She enjoys all the little and big things it can do...Alexa play this song, What time is it and where, and how to cook this and that!"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"Love, Love, Love!!"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Oak Finish 	Just what I expected....	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	"I love it, wife hates it."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	Really happy with this purchase.  Great speaker and easy to set up.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	We have only been using Alexa for a couple of days and are having a lot of fun with our new toy. It like having a new household member! We are trying to learn all the different featues and benefits that come with it.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	We love the size of the 2nd generation echo. Still needs a little improvement on sound	1
4	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	"I liked the original Echo. This is the same but shorter and with greater fabric/color choices. I miss the volume ring on top, now it's just the plus/minus buttons. Not a big deal but the ring w as comforting. :) Other than that, well I do like the use of a standard USB charger /port instead of the previous round pin. Other than that, I guess it sounds the same, seems to work the same, still answers to Alexa/Echo/Computer. So what's not to like? :)"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Love the Echo and how good the music sounds playing off it. Alexa understands most commands but it is difficult at times for her to find specific playlists or songs on Spotify. She is good with Amazon Music but is lacking in other major programs.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"We love Alexa! We use her to play music, play radio through iTunes, play podcasts through Anypod, and set reminders. We listen to our flash briefing of news and weather every morning. We rely on our custom lists. We like being able to voice control the volume. We're sure we'll continue to find new uses.Sometimes it's a bit frustrating when Alexa doesn't understand what we're saying."	1
4	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	"Have only had it set up for a few days. Still adding smart home devices to it. The speaker is great for playing music. I like the size, we have it stationed on the kitchen counter and it’s not intrusive to look at."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	I love it. It plays my sleep sounds immediately when I ask	1
3	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	"I got a second unit for the bedroom, I was expecting the sounds to be improved but I didnt really see a difference at all.  Overall, not a big improvement over the 1st generation."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	Amazing product	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"I love my Echo. It's easy to operate, loads of fun.It is everything as advertised. I use it mainly to play my favorite tunes and test Alexa's knowledge."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Sounds great!! Love them!	1
4	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"Fun item to play with and get used to using.  Sometimes has hard time answering the questions you ask, but I think it will be better."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Just like the other one	1
5	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	Still learning all the capabilities...but so far pretty pretty pretty good	1
4	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	I like it	1
5	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	"She works well. Needs a learning command  for unique, owners and users like. Alexa “learn” Tasha’s birthday.  Or Alexa “learn” my definition of Fine. Etc. other than that she is great"	1
3	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	The speakers sound pretty good for being so small and setup is pretty easy.  I bought two and the reason I only rate it a 3 is I have followed the instructions for synching music to both units.  I know I've done it correctly but they won't sync.  That was my primary motivation for purchasing multiple units.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	This device is awesome!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	I bought this to compare the speaker quality to our first generation speaker and i like the sound better.  I will ship this to my daughter though because I like the fact that my first generation has a chargeable base that we bought which keeps it more mobile and she needs a better sound than what she has now.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	"Love my Echo. Still learning all the things it will do. Wasn’t able to follow instructions included in the package, but found a great one on U-Tube."	1
4	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	Speaker is better than 1st generation Echo	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"This thing is way cool!  You should get one.  If you want to be cool, that is."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	"This is my first digital assistant so I'm giving this a good review. Speaker is really good for the cheap price on Prime day. Fun to play with and can be used as an alarm clock (That's what I was going to get in the first place, but I ended up with Echo). If you haven't had a go with one then definitely try it!What I like best is the number of other devices that it can connect with. My purchase came with a Smart Plug for $10 which I connect my lamp to. Alexa, turn of the lights!"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	My husband likes being able to use it to listen to music.  I wish we knew all it's capabilities	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"My Android would not allow Alexa to connect. Fortunately, my sister was here with her Apple cell. After an hour+ tech support fixed the glitches. We are up and running."	1
4	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	So far so good	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Tried to play certain broadway shows like Camelot and it gives ne the group Camelot.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	Great	1
5	30-Jul-18	Walnut Finish 	Very satisfied with the Echo. Alexa now controls the lights in my family room and my wife can listen to Jimmy Buffet by just asking Alexa.	1
2	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"It's like Siri, in fact, Siri answers more accurately then Alexa.  I don't see a real need for it in my household, though it was a good bargain on prime day deals."	0
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Love my Echo. Still learning how every thing works but having tons of fun.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	I love you so much	1
3	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	No different than Apple. To play a specific list of music you must have an Amazon of Spotify “plus/prime/etc” account.  So you must pay to play “your” music.  3 stars for that reason.  Everything else is 👍🏻 .	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"Excelente, lo unico es que no esta en español."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"I'm still learning how to use it, but so far my Echo is great! The sound is actually much better than I was expecting."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Works as you’d expect and then some. Also good sound quality considering price (70.00 on sale) and features.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	The sound from this Echo 2nd Generation is phenomenal!  Not to mention that I just love Alexa!  She is very helpful.	1
3	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	like google better	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Just had to have it and now lets play and learn how to get the most out of it.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Works as advertised. Very easy to setup. Still learning what this can do.	1
4	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Great sound and easy to set up.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Oak Finish 	"Love Alexa, bought others for friends"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Love the echo I purchased it for company for my husband he is 83 and Alexa is great all he has to do is say her name and she tells him a joke and plays his favorite songs	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	😍	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Love being able to listen to music easily. Still learning all the features available	1
4	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	"Did t really know what I could use this device for. Used it for a few things, but need an overview"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	Love this just wish it had a built in hub	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	I use it primarily to play music.  It works wonderfully!  Still getting used to some of the many things it will do.  Amazon has sent several tips since I got it. Thanks for all your help!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	How easy if was to set up.	1
4	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Fast response which was amazing.  Clear concise answers and sound quality is fantastic.  I am still getting used to Alexia and have not usde Echo to its full extent.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	You’re all I need...na na nana!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Does everything as expected and more.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	"I love my Echo!  Works just like they said it would. I don't have a &#34;smart&#34; home, so I cannot speak about that function, but everything else about it is good."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Great sound in a small package—easy to set up and use; fun to own.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Works and sounds great.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	The sound is amazing and many collections of all music	1
4	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	Setting up	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	She doesn’t always listen	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	It’s awesome	1
4	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	"I bought this because it can control fios television. It works well. I’m hoping over time it will do more to control fios. Then I discovered all the other things Alexa can do. Play music you ask for. Great sound from Alexa. Play games. Play radio stations. Play old time radio programs like the Long Ranger. Alexa has many “apps” you can add to her abilities. The other day I played Madlibs. Great fun. Also Alexa can control household appliances. I just purchased Alexa compatible power strips to control lighting, fans and TV components. I’m looking forward to implementing this controll. You can also add other Alexa components to have chosen music to play in all rooms where the components are located."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	The speaker has excellent sound and works perfectly!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	I LIKE IT ALL	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	I love it. It does everything	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	I was a little nervous when I received my new Echo as I'm not really Tech savvy. I found it a bit intimidating at first but it didn't take me to long to figure it out!! I'm very happy with my purchase and now thinking of adding an echo spot!!!	1
4	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	I like it and still learning how to use it.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Great technology!! Can't believe the speaker volume and quality is so wonderful. Wish I had bought another one!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	"I purchased an echo dot for my husband for Fathers Day.  He uses it constantly and after hearing the quality of sound of the Echo (2nd Generation), It was a no-brainer.  Best gift ever!"	1
4	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Works fine!!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	 	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Clear music	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"Fun to use, good sound quality"	1
5	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	The echo works well. I was able to sync it with my other Amazon music devices.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"Works great, but I don't think Amazon should charge another cent for unlimited music when you 1) Have Prime AND 2) Buy an Echo."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Already had an Echo Dot. The Echo is even better with fuller sound. Also during setup it now lets phone calls to be made to my contact list which is great!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	The speaker sounds really good	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	Good sound works well	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Love it and Alexa. I am not very savvy but support was very helpful and patient.	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"Love it! I was thinking about getting one and when the prime day discount was offered, I could not pass it up! It's fun to ask Alexa to play any song or group and she comes up with a playlist from Amazon Prime Music. You can also connect your iPhone with bluetooth and play music with Pandora or YouTube videos using Alexa as a speaker. I've been having fun asking Alexa different types of questions or for information like weather, news or even the time in other countries. The only downside is if you have limited data on your wifi plan, because Alexa uses burns it up when playing music."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	"We like it all so far, but have a lot to try out yet."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric 	Love it - am using it strictly for music now and it's great!	1
5	30-Jul-18	Sandstone Fabric 	"Love the Echo !!! I love the size, material and speaker quality. I have it hooked up to one light easily and will work on additional lights and thermostat. Next is Echo Dot for bedroom. There is a lot more to do with Echo that you think. Traffic, Weather, Trivia, etc."	1
4	30-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric 	Love it!	1
